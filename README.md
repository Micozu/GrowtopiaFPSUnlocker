# Growtopia FPS Unlocker & Monitor

A simple FPS monitoring application built with Python and PyQt5. This application allows you to monitor the FPS (frames per second) of any running process on your Windows machine. It provides a sleek, green and black themed interface where users can select a running process, view the FPS, and overlay it onto the window of the selected application.

The application uses `psutil` for fetching running processes, `Pillow` for capturing screen content, and `win32gui` for handling window manipulation and overlaying FPS on the selected window.

## Features

- **Process Selection**: Select any running process to monitor.
- **FPS Display**: Show real-time FPS of the selected process.
- **Overlay FPS**: Display the FPS in the top-left corner of the window for the selected application.
- **Process Filtering**: Filter the process list by typing in the search bar.
